# Backend Project

A **production-oriented backend system** built using the **MERN backend stack**, designed to evolve step-by-step from a traditional REST-based architecture to scalable, event-driven backend systems.

This repository is maintained as a **backend engineering lab**, with a strict focus on fundamentals, correctness, clean structure, and real-world backend development practices.

This is **not** a demo or tutorial repository.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project exists to:
- Strengthen backend engineering fundamentals  
- Learn backend technologies through **implementation**, not theory  
- Understand how backend systems evolve in real-world applications  
- Practice clean architecture, API design, and version control discipline  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Phase-wise)

### Phase 1 — Core Backend (Current)
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Express.js
- RESTful APIs
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- npm

### Phase 2 — Advanced Backend Patterns (Planned)
- Modular architecture
- Advanced MongoDB data modeling
- Aggregation pipelines
- Authentication & authorization

### Phase 3 — Event-Driven & Scalable Systems (Planned)
- Message queues / event streaming
- Asynchronous communication
- Distributed backend concepts

## 🌱 Repository Evolution Strategy

This repository evolves **without changing its identity**, reflecting real backend system growth:

- `main` branch  
  → Node.js + Express + MongoDB (REST-based backend)

- `advanced` branch  
  → Optimized MongoDB schemas and backend patterns

- `event-driven` branch  
  → Event-based backend architecture

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`  
3. Configure environment variables  
4. Start the server  
5. Verify API responses using a REST client  

---

## 📌 Status

🚧 Under active development  
Features are added incrementally with clean, meaningful commits.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Build before optimizing  
- One feature at a time  
- Depth over breadth  
- Engineering discipline over shortcuts
